# flexbox-arch-company

A project from Codecadmy asking us to build a company website using Flexbox.

To save time, I used [this example](https://www.wix.com/website-template/view/html/1869) from Wix as my challenge.

This project doesn't require us to make it responsive as there's another challenge for it.

However, as it is inevitable to make responsive pages as a frontend developer, I make it so to get used to it.
